      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I am currently studying IT and working through courses in web design and
        networking. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood and
        then using that knowledge to solve everyday problems, whether that means
        fixing a device or building something new.

        Prior to returning to school, I’ve worked as a field service technician,
        supporting payment systems and transit equipment amongst other
        responsibilities. The experience taught me how to deal with pressure,
        real-world issues that aren’t in any manual, and communicate clearly
        with non-technical people. Eventually, I’d like to combine that
        background with my studies to move into remote-friendly tech roles.
